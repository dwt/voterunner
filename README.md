Many Ideas emerge these days under the buzzword "liquid democracy".
This app tries to allow for quick and dirty votes and discussion.

It is basically the concept behind [votorolla](http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.xht)
mixed with the interface of [etherpad](http://etherpad.org/).

Technically, it is a lot of client side code with a bit of 
[socket.io](http://socket.io) magic on the server.
